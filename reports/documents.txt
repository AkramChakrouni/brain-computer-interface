Usage Workflow
1.  Run update_base_dataset.py: This will monitor the users folder for new user subfolders 
    and update the base dataset when a new user is added.

2.  Run processing_user_dataset.py: This will process new user datasets 
    and train initial user-specific models.

3.  Run update_user_model.py: This will prompt existing users to update 
    their models if the base dataset has grown.

This setup ensures that new user-specific models are trained on both the latest base dataset 
and the user-specific dataset with higher weight, and existing users are prompted to update their models 
when the base dataset grows. Adjust the placeholder model training code with your actual 
model training code as needed.
